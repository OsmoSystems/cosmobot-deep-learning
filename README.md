Cosmobot deep learning models and helper code

## Iterating on models

### Branching vs submodules

There will be one submodule for every major type of model, with the best version of each checked into master.

If you are making tweaks to a model, do so in a branch. If the tweaks turn out to be an improvement on that model, land them.

### Documenting changes

Create a directory in the Experiments directory on Google Drive with a README detailing your changes and results.

Reference your branch name or changeset in the README.

### Iterating with Jupyter notebooks
