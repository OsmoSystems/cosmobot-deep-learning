Cosmobot deep learning models and helper code

## Iterating on models

### Branching vs submodules

There will be one model checked in to master (ideally our current best).

If you are tweaking the master model, do so in a branch.

If you are trying out a model that is significantly different from the one in master, create a new sub-module for it.

### Documenting changes

Create a directory in the Experiments directory on Google Drive with a README detailing your changes and results.

Reference your branch name or changeset in the README.

### Iterating with Jupyter notebooks
